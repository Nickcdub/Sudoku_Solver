This is a project I used to learn more about React. It accepts an input sudoku grid and outputs a solution that incorporates the user-filled fields and follows the rules of Sudoku. If the grid is invalid or can't be solved, the output will tell the user that it can't be solved.
Here is the public-facing browser URL for this app: https://nickcdub.github.io/Sudoku_Solver/

I used Vite to initialize this project:


# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
