Have a function that checks the possible numbers in a certain square.
Imagine we have row (x) and column (y), Given a number n between 1-9:
    check y's index 0-8 for that number, found it? return false
    Do the same for x's index 0-8
    Do the same for the submitrix 

Now we get to the actual recursive function:
Imagine we have row (x) and column (y):
Iterate row by row, column by column
    If the grid cell is empty (== 0) check n from 1-9
        If n can be put into the cell without collision
            put in n
            recall this function
            reset this cell == 0 //If we hit this, then we are backtracking  
    return //(We've hit a dead end, no n fits, turn back)
